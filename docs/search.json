I have been working as IT analsyt for first 3 year. Then i want to switch carrer path and move to analytic role within IT department. I worked as Data Analyst since then. I hope with this programm i will be forward in this carrer path more efficient.\nHere is my Linkedin profile also -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/eceacaroglu/\n##rconf (2022) ##R, Python, and Tableau: A Love Triangle\nUsers often want access to more advanced analytical capabilities in their Tableau dashboards. In this video, suggestions and examples are given about how analyzes made with R and python can actually be used better with tableau in daily life. Thus, the analysis becomes easier to use in business life and can be accessed by everyone.\nhttps://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/r-python-tableau-love-triangle/\n##My interests\nhttps://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html\nIn this website it show capabilities of R and ggplot2 for visualization.\nAnd also there is a website which show art make with R programme. You can purhase some arts also :) Sometimes programming can be used to generate figures that are aestetically pleasing, but don’t bring any insight.
